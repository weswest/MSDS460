# MSDS460
Coursework for Northwestern MSDS-460 Decision Analytics

## Structure of Course

This course focused on linear optimization for the first six weeks, and then focused on monte carlo simulations for the remaining four weeks.  Homework assignments were due every other week.

## Highlight - Final Project

I advise you check out the [final project](https://github.com/weswest/MSDS460/tree/master/Wk10%20Final%20Project), where I created a Python-based simulation of my Modeling and Analytics team to evaluate whether different FTE levels could manage target workloads.

## Highlight - Ohio Redistricting
I'm also (somewhat) proud of [Homework 3: Redistricting](https://github.com/weswest/MSDS460/tree/master/For%20Github/MSDS460%20-%20Decision%20Analytics/HW3%20-%20Ohio%20Redistricting).  We were tasked with creating an algorithm-based redistricting map for a target state (Ohio, in my case), maintaining similar population levels and adhering to racial balance.
